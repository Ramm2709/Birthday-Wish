Happy Birthday, my favourite person in the whole world 🫶🏻💗💋

To the most beautiful soul I’ve ever known - my strongest, sweetest, softest girl 🤍🧿. You’re silly and stubborn sometimes, but that’s exactly what makes you so adorable, so you 🥹💗. Every little part of your behaviour makes my heart melt; sometimes I honestly can’t handle how cute you are 😘🫂.

Above all, you’re the one girl who leaves me speechless… the one who makes me so proud every single day 💗🌍. I don’t even have enough words to tell you how precious you are to me, how amazing you are, babe ❤️‍🩹. You don’t know how much I like you, how much I admire you - when I see you from afar, my eyes only look for you, my smile only rises for you, and my heart screams your name 🫀💗.

Babe, you’re my everything… truly one in a million, the star of my entire universe 🫶🏻🌍💗. I love you for who you really are - your perfections, imperfections, strengths, weaknesses, your good days and your bad ones ❤️‍🩹. And I want to know every hidden side of you, every piece you keep to yourself… and love that too 🤍🫂.

Whenever you feel you’re not enough, remember: to me, you’re more than enough - you’re already half of me now 🫀💗. You live inside my heart, and I can’t imagine losing you or I’d lose a part of myself ❤️‍🩹.

Babe, I’m so grateful to be standing here today, celebrating your day with you… knowing that meeting you was the best thing that’s happened to me 🫶🏻🥹💗.

Happy Birthday once again, my love 🫶🏻💗💋😘
